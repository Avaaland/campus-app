# Campus Life Super App

## Project Overview

The Campus Life Super App is a web application that I have designed to help students at North Park University quickly find events and dining options on or around campus. To help navigate I have added a campus map, and I have also added a live weather function so students can plan their day more easily.

This project is for my final project for my Web Development class to show skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, API integration, and deployment with Github Pages.

## Features

1. Home Page
- Top header with university logo + live weather widget using the Open-Meteo API.
- Gold fetaure bar with links to:
    - Campus Events
    - Campus Dining
    - Campus Map
- Campus map that opens to a bigger picture when clicked. Will close if you press out of it.
- Full-screen image carousel with inspirational quotes. Photos rotate automatically every 5 seconds, and has next/previous controls and dots for navigation.
- Back to top button at the bottom

2. Campus Events Page
- Layout of event cards which show:
    - Event
    - Date and time of event
    - Description
    - Location
- Back to home link at the top, and back to top button at the bottom

3. Campus Dining Page
- Layout of dining cards, either on or near campus options:
    - Restaurant name
    - Days and hours that they are open
    - Description
    - Location
- Uses same style as events page
Back to home link at the top, and back to top button at the bottom

## Technologies Used
- HTML for page structure
- CSS for custom styling and layout
- Bootstrap for responsive grid and utility classes
- Javascript for interactivity:
    - Carousel logic
    - Back to top button
    - Weather API
    - Map image modal
- Open-Meteo for live weather data near North Park University
- Git and Github for version control
- Github Pages for deployment

## Here is how to run th project locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project folder in your code editor
3. Open index.html in your browser

## Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would have liked to add maybe something like a search or filter for events. This way, you could filter by date or category. I also think it would be interesting to have real dining menus pulled up from an API or JSON file. And lastly, I think it would improve accessibility and preferences to have a toggle for light/dark mode.
